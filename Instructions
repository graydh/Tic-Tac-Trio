Welcome to TriTacToe!


A "trio" is any group of 3 of symbols in order either horizontally or vertically.
Each "trio" is one point when the game is finished which is when the board is full.

Every three in a row that can be connected from a point counts as one complete "trio"
A Point can only be drawn from once.
Diagonals do not count.

e.g.

0 0 0 2
0 1 2 3
0 2 1 3
1 1 2 2

Score: 3
The top three zeros count for 2 points, the left three zeros only count for one point because the top left zero was already "used" in the top row. 


e.g.

1 1 1 1
2 3 1 2
0 1 0 2
2 2 2 0

Score: 6
The Row of four 1's is 4 points, (each 1 can be drawn into a unique "trio") the bottom 2's count for 2 points (two separate "trios" can be drawn).
